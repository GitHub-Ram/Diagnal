# Diagnal
# Demonstrated proficiency in Kotlin / MVVM / Dependency Injection (Hilt)/ Composable through this application development
# I have just started doing and learning Composable
# I used Hilt other than Dagger because I wanted to test my knowledge of Hilt while doing this project
# I tried to follow DI but while implementing search using Paging 3. I found it hard to invalidate PagingSource without providing new instance of PagingSource factory to Pager object
# Searching needed to invalidate PagingSource and invalidating PagingSource causes recreation of Pager and PagingSource factory. 
# I need check when will get time how to solve this DI
